# Outline for Day #2 - Major International Issues

## Rosewood Trade
### Problems
`[Frame 16]`
**Problem #1:** Many species, some protected, some not  
  - Tracking each log in each shipment extremely difficult

`[Frame 18]`
**Problem #2:** Species protected by national export bans (or other laws) have no protection once exported (unless internationally protected)  
  - Can be legally purchased in other countries, even if harvest and export was illegal

`[Frame 20]`
**Problem #3:** In many countries with harvesting and/or export laws, is some legal trade that creates loopholes for the illegal trade

### Notes
See the U.S. Lacey Act, the E.U. Timber Regulations, and the Australian Illegal Logging Prohibitions Act as exceptions where import is banned in these countries if *any part* of the chain is illegal *in any country* along the supply chain.


## Fashion

- Farming is common for many of these species, and trade is legal  
- Represents an opportunity for illegally harvested wild products to make it into the legal market


## Cosmetics & Perfume
`[Frame 52]`
**Problems**  
- Perhaps the most valuable per-capita item in the international wildlife trade  
  - Extreme value is leading to a "gold rush" for most valuable wild trees  
  - Overexploitation of wild populations occurring

- Species identification a problem (not all are protected)  

- Relatively easy to smuggle across borders (chips, oils, etc.)

- Mixing of illegal wild-harvest with legal cultivated harvested


## Pet, Zoos, & Breeding

2. In 1992, US banned most imports of birds (Wild Bird Conservation Act)
  - US destination for just 4%, EU destination for 59%  
  - Top 5 legal exporters: South Africa, the EU, China, Pakistan, and Senegal

3. In 2005, EU bans import of wild birds  
  - 35% of legal trade goes to Mexico  
  - Markets in the Middle East and Asia grow

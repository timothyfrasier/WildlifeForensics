# Wildlife Forensics

This repository contains content and information for my Wildlife Forensics course.

See the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) as one important body. Some of their role is described in Brakes et al. (2019) Science 363(6431): 1032-1034. Also CITES and the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).

# Case Study Assignment

Your main assignment for this course (other than the labs and the exams) will be a research project on a particular case study in wildlife forensics. Your responsibilities for this assignment are to:  
  1. **Conduct in-depth research** on your topic so that you understand the main drivers behind it, what the implications are for the species/people/environment(s) involved, what the major legal issues are, and who is/should be responsible for enforcing them.  
  2. **Teach the class about this case study** via a presentation, activity, and/or by leading a discussion. This can *include* a presentation, but cannot *only* consist of a presentation (i.e., you may give a brief presentation, but if you do, you must also lead the class in a discussion or activity associated with this topic).  

You will be provided with a few references to get your started, but this should just be a *starting point*, and  you are expected to do much more research above and beyond the reference with which you are provided.

**Timing:** You will have the entire class period (i.e., 75 minutes) for this, and are expected to use that time effectively.  

**Structure:** You will work in teams of 2 or 3 individuals.  

### Grading
Your grade will be broken down into five components:  

  1. **Thoroughness of Research (40%).** Based on your presentation/discussion/activity it should be clear how in-depth you investigated your topic. Again, it is expected that your research will be in-depth and go well beyond the references originally provided, rather than just scratching the surface.  

  2. **Clarity and Effectiveness of Your Presentation/Discussion/Activity (40%).** This is an evaluation of how well you teach the class about your topic. Did you teach the class in a clear and effective way that was interesting and engaging; or was it dry, boring, and/or hard to follow? Did the students effectively learn much more about the topic than they could have just by reading the initial references? The students should walk away from your discussion/activity with a thorough understanding of the topic, at a much deeper level than would be possible with just the assigned readings.  

  3. **Anonymous peer evaluation (20%).** You will anonymously evaluate your other group member(s). This will include two different scores, each out of 10. One score will be for their contribution to the project (i.e., how helpful were they in doing the research and preparing for the associated activities during class time). The second score will be for their professional behaviour. For example, someone who did a lot of good work, but was difficult to work with might score high for their contribution, but low for their professional behaviour. On the other hand, someone who didn't contribute as much as expected, but who always had a good attitude and was pleasant to work with may score low on contribution and higher on their professional behaviour. You should not just give everyone 100%: we are not in elementary school anymore. Instead, you should be honest and fair: if someone doesn't deserve 100%, they should not get it.
